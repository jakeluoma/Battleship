PlayerLogic.getRunsOfTilesWithNoAttackLengthN() might be improved to check each tile whether the run going right and the run going down both have no attack.
If both are clear, return both, else return neither.  Accept if one of the runs goes off the board and all tiles in it have not been attacked.
I think this will work more efficiently without leaving any tiles out.  Could further improve so that runs don't overlap.  Then, as long as you always attack
a given position in a run, will achieve complete coverage most efficiently.
